Daemonset is one of the controllers in Kubernetes, it ensures a particular pod is running in all nodes of the cluster.

When a new node is added to the cluster it will add the pod to the new node and when a node is removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected.

Typical uses:
1, Storage daemons (e.g. glusterd)
2, Log collectors (e.g. fluentd)
3, Monitoring daemons (e.g. Prometheus Node Exporter)
